It could be cool to include a level editor if there is time. Give playera a blank grid and selection of tiles and see what kind of puzzle they can come up with. 

track high scores on the single computer so that over multiple tries theey can see if they get better. 


Tile ideas
* multiplier
* congruent tiles
* on the edge
* destroys a large cunk if destroyed
* every diferent type adjecent
* -1 for every same type adjecent
